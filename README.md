## 🎮 Overview

**Guess My Number** challenges you to find a secret number between **1 and 20**.  
Each incorrect guess decreases your score the faster you find the right number, the higher your final score.  

This project was created as part of a JavaScript Udemy course and rebuilt from scratch by following various coding challenges.  
It’s designed to reinforce core front-end concepts like **real-time UI updates**, **user input validation**, and **conditional logic**.  
All logic is implemented in pure JavaScript, no external libraries or frameworks.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Handling **user input** with `querySelector` and event listeners  
- Creating and updating **dynamic DOM content**  
- Managing state using variables like `score`, `highscore`, and `secretNumber`  
- Writing reusable functions like `displayMessage()`  
- Using **conditional operators** and concise logic structures  
- Improving the user experience through small visual details  

This project was an excellent hands-on exercise in combining JavaScript logic with real-time user interaction and UI feedback.
